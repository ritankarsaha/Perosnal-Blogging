# Understanding IP Addresses

**Contributors:** Ritankar Saha (Author)

## What is an IP Address?

IP stands for **Internet Protocol**. IP addresses are used by devices to connect over the Internet and/or locally. They govern the format of data sent locally or via the internet.

In essence, IP addresses are identifiers that allow devices to send information over the internet between devices or over a network. They contain location information and make the devices available for communication. The internet further needs a way to differentiate between the vast range of devices we have — routers, mobiles, computers, laptops, etc. Generating and assigning IP addresses is the process of doing that.



## Versions of IP Addresses

There are two different versions of IP addresses: **IPv4** and **IPv6**. Let’s take a deep dive into both of them.

### IPv4

The original Internet Protocol was IPv4. It uses a 32-bit dot-decimal notation which can incorporate around 4 billion IP addresses. As Internet adoption grew, we needed something better.

**Example:** `102.22.192.181`

### IPv6

The newer generation Internet Protocol is IPv6. It uses a 128-bit alphanumerical hexadecimal notation which can roughly incorporate around ~340e+36 IP addresses. This is more than enough to meet today’s demands.

**Example:** `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

## Types of IP Addresses

There are different types of IP addresses. Let’s deep dive into each of them.

### Public IP Address

A public IP address is one where one IP address is associated with the entire network. In this type of system, every device on the network has the same IP address when connected to the network.

**Example:** The IP address provided to your router by the ISP.

### Private IP Address

A private IP address is one where every device is connected with its own unique IP address to the network. All the devices are connected with a unique IP number while connecting to the network.

**Example:** IP addresses generated by your home router for your devices.

### Static IP Address

A static IP address is one that is usually developed by the concerned user. They are better encrypted and safer to use than regular IP addresses. A static address does not change and is manually created as opposed to being assigned.

**Example:** They are usually used for important things like reliable geo-location services, remote access, server hosting, etc.

### Dynamic IP Address

A dynamic IP address changes from time to time. They are assigned by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). They are cheaper to deploy and can be reused as and when required by the devices within the network. They are the most common type of IP addresses available over the Internet.

**Example:** They are more commonly used for consumer equipment and personal use.

## Conclusion

Understanding IP addresses is crucial for navigating the complex world of internet and network connectivity. The distinction between IPv4 and IPv6, as well as the different types of IP addresses (public, private, static, and dynamic), provides a foundational knowledge for both everyday users and IT professionals.
